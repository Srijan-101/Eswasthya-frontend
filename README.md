"Ewasthya" is a prototype of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system aimed at digitizing health information. The application targets the government, enabling them to track the health data of individual citizens with a unique health ID while supporting demographic visualization of the data.

Some salient features of this project are:

- Appointment booking with OTP verification: Users can book appointments and verify their identity through OTP (One-Time Password) to grant access to their medical history for doctors.
- Doctor's capability to update medical information: Doctors can update details such as allergic drugs, vaccination records, medical reports, and other medical information in the patient's medical history.
- Easy accessibility of medical history: Doctors have convenient access to the complete medical history of patients.
- Pneumonia prediction using machine learning: The project incorporates a machine learning model for pneumonia prediction, utilizing the stored data to train the model and provide predictive insights.
- Demographic visualization for government: The application offers demographic visualization features for government entities. This enables tracking of medication, vaccination records, and disease outbreaks at various levels such as province, district, and municipality.
